<h1 align="center">Linear Regression and Goodness of fit</h1>

# About
This repository is a compilation of the R codes and the final submission of my third coursework doing MATH20811 Practical Statistics on Linear Regression. Based on the data provided, the report explores how they may be related linearly, estimating and commenting through tests on the parameters for the model as well the fitted values. The residuals of the estimation is then looked into to examine the plausibility of the assumptions in the regression model through Normal quantile-quantile plot and goodness-of-fit tests, specifically the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test.
