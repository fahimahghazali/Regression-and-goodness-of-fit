<h1 align="center">Linear Regression and Goodness of fit</h1>

### Project Objective
This project is the final submission of my third coursework doing MATH20811 Practical Statistics on Linear Regression. Based on the data provided, the report explores how they may be related linearly, estimating and commenting through tests on the parameters for the model as well the fitted values. The residuals of the estimation is then looked into to examine the plausibility of the assumptions in the regression model through Normal quantile-quantile plot and goodness-of-fit tests, specifically the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test.

## Project Description
The  data used for this project can be obtained from [Analysis of Risk Premium in Motor Insurance](https://github.com/fahimahghazali/Linear-regression-and-goodness-of-fit/blob/main/sweden_ins_data.txt) where the `claims` is the predictor variable denoted by x and the `payment` is the response variable denoted by y. With the n = 63 observations, a simple linear regression is assumed through the scatterplot of x against y and the parameters are estimated using formulas learned in the course. Instead of using the built-in `lm` function in R,
